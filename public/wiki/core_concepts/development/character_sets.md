## **1. What is a Character Set?**
A **character set** is a defined collection of characters (letters, numbers, symbols, etc.) that a computer system recognizes and can display. Each character is assigned a unique numerical value, allowing computers to store, transmit, and render text consistently.

## **2. Key Concepts**
### **a. Code Points**
- Each character in a set is assigned a **code point**, a unique numerical identifier (e.g., the code point for the uppercase letter "A" is 65 in the ASCII set).
- Code points are often represented in hexadecimal (e.g., `U+0041` for "A").

### **b. Encoding**
- **Encoding** is the process of converting characters into binary (or other formats) for storage or transmission.
- **Decoding** is the reverse process, converting binary back into characters.

## **3. Common Character Sets**
### **a. ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)**
- **Size:** 128 characters (7-bit).
- **Scope:** Basic Latin letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), punctuation, and control characters (e.g., newline, tab).
- **Limitation:** Only supports English and lacks accents or special symbols for other languages.

### **b. Extended ASCII**
- **Size:** 256 characters (8-bit).
- **Scope:** Adds symbols for European languages (e.g., é, ü, ñ).
- **Limitation:** Still limited; multiple extended ASCII variants exist, causing compatibility issues.

### **c. Unicode**
- **Size:** Over 144,000 characters (as of 2025) and growing.
- **Scope:** Supports almost all writing systems (Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, Chinese, emojis, etc.).
- **Encoding Schemes:**
  - **UTF-8:** Variable-width (1–4 bytes per character). Backward-compatible with ASCII. Most widely used on the web.
  - **UTF-16:** Variable-width (2 or 4 bytes per character). Used in Windows and Java.
  - **UTF-32:** Fixed-width (4 bytes per character). Rarely used due to inefficiency.

### **d. ISO/IEC 8859**
- **Size:** 256 characters (8-bit).
- **Scope:** A family of 16 sets (e.g., ISO 8859-1 for Western European languages, ISO 8859-5 for Cyrillic).
- **Limitation:** Limited to specific language groups.

---

## **4. Why Unicode Dominates**
- **Universality:** Supports all major scripts and symbols.
- **Flexibility:** UTF-8 is space-efficient for ASCII and scalable for global text.
- **Standardization:** Avoids conflicts between regional encodings.

---

## **5. Practical Implications**
- **Compatibility:** Mismatched encodings can cause "mojibake" (garbled text, e.g., `Ã©` instead of `é`).
- **Web Development:** HTML5 defaults to UTF-8. Always declare encoding (e.g., `<meta charset="UTF-8">`).
- **Programming:** Strings in code are often UTF-8/UTF-16. Libraries handle encoding/decoding (e.g., Python’s `encode()`/`decode()`).

## **6. Example: Encoding "Hello"**
| Character | ASCII (Decimal) | UTF-8 (Hex) |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| H         | 72              | 0x48        |
| e         | 101             | 0x65        |
| l         | 108             | 0x6C        |
| l         | 108             | 0x6C        |
| o         | 111             | 0x6F        |

## **7. Common Issues**
- **Mojibake:** Occurs when text is decoded using the wrong encoding.
- **Legacy Systems:** Older systems may only support ASCII or regional encodings.
- **File Transfers:** Ensure consistent encoding between sender/receiver.

### **Key Takeaway**
Character sets define how text is represented digitally. **Unicode (UTF-8)** is the modern standard, ensuring global compatibility, while older sets like ASCII remain relevant for specific use cases.
