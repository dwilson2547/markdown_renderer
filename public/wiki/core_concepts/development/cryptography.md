**Cryptography** is the science of securing information by transforming it into a form that is unintelligible to unauthorized parties. It encompasses techniques for ensuring **confidentiality**, **integrity**, **authentication**, and **non-repudiation** in digital communication and data storage.

## **1. What Is Cryptography?**
Cryptography is the practice of:
- **Enciphering** (encrypting) data so it can only be read by intended recipients.
- **Deciphering** (decrypting) data back to its original form.
- **Verifying** the authenticity and integrity of data.

It is the foundation of secure communication, digital signatures, and data protection in the digital age.

## **2. Goals of Cryptography**
| Goal | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Confidentiality** | Ensures only authorized parties can access data. | Encrypting emails or files. |
| **Integrity** | Ensures data hasn’t been altered. | Hashing files or using digital signatures. |
| **Authentication** | Verifies the identity of users or systems. | Digital certificates, passwords. |
| **Non-repudiation** | Prevents parties from denying their actions. | Digital signatures in contracts. |

## **3. Core Techniques in Cryptography**

### **A. Encryption**
- **[Symmetric Encryption](encryption.md)**: Uses the same key for encryption and decryption.
  - Example: **[AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)](encryption.md)**.
- **[Asymmetric Encryption](encryption.md)**: Uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
  - Example: **[RSA, ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)](encryption.md)**.

### **B. Hashing**
- Converts data into a fixed-size string (hash) for integrity checks.
- **One-way function**: Cannot reverse the hash to get the original data.
  - Example: **SHA-256, bcrypt**.

### **C. Digital Signatures**
- Uses **[asymmetric encryption](encryption.md)** to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message.
- The sender signs the message with their private key, and the recipient verifies it with the sender’s public key.
  - Example: **RSA signatures, ECDSA**.

### **D. Key Exchange**
- Securely exchanges cryptographic keys over insecure channels.
  - Example: **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**.

## **4. Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Cryptography**

| Feature | Symmetric Cryptography | Asymmetric Cryptography |
|---------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Key Type** | Single shared key. | Public and private key pair. |
| **Speed** | Fast. | Slow. |
| **Use Case** | Encrypting large data (e.g., files, databases). | Key exchange, digital signatures. |
| **Example Algorithms** | AES, ChaCha20. | RSA, ECC, Diffie-Hellman. |

## **5. How Cryptography Works in Practice**

### **A. Secure Communication (TLS/SSL)**
1. **Handshake**: The client and server agree on a symmetric key using asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA or Diffie-Hellman).
2. **Encryption**: All communication is encrypted using the symmetric key (e.g., AES).

### **B. Digital Signatures**
1. **Signing**: The sender hashes the message and encrypts the hash with their private key.
2. **Verification**: The recipient decrypts the signature with the sender’s public key and compares it to a newly computed hash of the message.

### **C. Password Storage**
1. **Hashing**: Store only the hash of a password (e.g., using bcrypt).
2. **Salting**: Add a unique random value (salt) to each password before hashing to prevent rainbow table attacks.

## **6. Common Cryptographic Algorithms**

| Category | Algorithm | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Symmetric Encryption** | AES | Standard for encrypting data (128, 192, or 256-bit keys). |
| **Asymmetric Encryption** | RSA | Used for key exchange and digital signatures. |
| **Hashing** | SHA-256 | Produces a 256-bit hash for data integrity. |
| **Key Exchange** | Diffie-Hellman | Allows two parties to securely exchange keys. |
| **Digital Signatures** | ECDSA | Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. |

## **7. Real-World Applications**

| Application | Cryptographic Technique | Example |
|-------------|--------------------------|---------|
| **HTTPS** | TLS (Symmetric + Asymmetric) | Securing web traffic. |
| **Bitcoin** | SHA-256, ECDSA | Blockchain and transaction signing. |
| **Signal/WhatsApp** | End-to-End Encryption (AES, ECC) | Secure messaging. |

## **8. Cryptography in Code**

### **A. Symmetric Encryption (AES in Python)**
```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes

# Generate a random 256-bit key
key = get_random_bytes(32)

# Encrypt
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_EAX)
ciphertext, tag = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(b"Hello, world!")
print("Ciphertext:", ciphertext.hex())

# Decrypt
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_EAX, cipher.nonce)
plaintext = cipher.decrypt_and_verify(ciphertext, tag)
print("Plaintext:", plaintext.decode("utf-8"))
```

### **B. Digital Signatures (RSA in Python)**
```python
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Signature import pkcs1_15
from Crypto.Hash import SHA256

# Generate key pair
key = RSA.generate(2048)
private_key = key.export_key()
public_key = key.publickey().export_key()

# Sign a message
message = b"Hello, world!"
hash = SHA256.new(message)
signature = pkcs1_15.new(RSA.import_key(private_key)).sign(hash)

# Verify the signature
try:
    pkcs1_15.new(RSA.import_key(public_key)).verify(hash, signature)
    print("Signature is valid.")
except:
    print("Signature is invalid.")
```

## **9. Challenges and Considerations**
- **Key Management**: Securely storing and distributing keys is critical.
- **Quantum Computing**: Future quantum computers may break widely used algorithms like RSA and ECC.
- **Side-Channel Attacks**: Attacks that exploit physical implementation (e.g., timing attacks).
- **Algorithm Longevity**: Regularly update algorithms to stay ahead of advancements in computing power.

## **10. The Future of Cryptography**
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Developing algorithms resistant to quantum computing (e.g., lattice-based cryptography).
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Allows computation on encrypted data without decrypting it.
- **Blockchain and Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Enhancing privacy and security in decentralized systems.
