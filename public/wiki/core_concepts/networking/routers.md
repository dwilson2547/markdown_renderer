#### **1. What is Network Routing?**
- **Routing** is the process of forwarding **data packets** between **different networks** (e.g., your local network and the internet).
- **Routers** are **Layer 3 (Network Layer)** devices that use **IP addresses** to determine the best path for data to travel from source to destination.

---

#### **2. How Routers Work**
- **Packet Inspection**: Routers examine the **destination IP address** of each packet.
- **Path Determination**: Using a **routing table**, the router decides the optimal path for the packet.
- **NAT (Network Address Translation)**: Routers often translate between **private IP addresses** (e.g., `192.168.1.1`) and **public IP addresses** (e.g., `203.0.113.45`).
- **Connecting Networks**: Routers link **multiple networks**, such as your home network and the internet.

#### **3. Key Functions of a Router**
- **Inter-network Communication**: Routes data between **different networks** (e.g., LAN to WAN).
- **Traffic Management**: Uses protocols like **OSPF, BGP, or RIP** to find the best path.
- **Security**: Often includes **firewall** features to filter traffic.
- **DHCP**: Assigns **IP addresses** to devices on the local network.

#### **4. How Switches Differ from Routers**



| Feature               | Router                                      | Switch                                      |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Layer**             | Operates at **Layer 3 (Network)**           | Operates at **Layer 2 (Data Link)**         |
| **Purpose**           | Connects **different networks** (e.g., LAN to WAN) | Connects **devices within the same network** |
| **Addressing**        | Uses **IP addresses**                       | Uses **MAC addresses**                      |
| **Forwarding**        | Forwards packets based on **IP routes**    | Forwards frames based on **MAC addresses**  |
| **Broadcast Domain**  | Separates broadcast domains                 | All ports share one broadcast domain (unless using VLANs) |
| **NAT**               | Supports NAT for private/public IP translation | No NAT functionality                        |
| **Example Use**       | Connects your home network to the internet  | Connects your computer, printer, and TV at home |

#### **5. Why Both Are Needed**
- **Switches** efficiently handle **local traffic** within a single network.
- **Routers** enable communication **between networks**, such as accessing the internet or connecting to a remote office.

---

#### **6. Practical Example**
- **Switch**: If your laptop sends a file to your printer, the switch forwards the data **directly to the printer** within your home network.
- **Router**: If your laptop requests a webpage, the router forwards the request to the **internet** and returns the response to your laptop.

#### **7. Modern Routers**
- **Wireless Routers**: Combine routing with **Wi-Fi access**.
- **Enterprise Routers**: Handle complex networks with advanced features like **VPN, QoS, and multiple WAN links**.
