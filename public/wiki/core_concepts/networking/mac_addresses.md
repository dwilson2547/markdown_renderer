## **1. What Is a MAC Address?**

A **Media Access Control (MAC) address** is a **unique identifier** assigned to a **Network Interface Card (NIC)** or network interface of a device. It is a **hardware address** used to identify devices on a **local network segment**.

### **Key Characteristics**
- **Unique Identifier**: Each NIC has a globally unique MAC address.
- **Hardware Address**: Assigned by the manufacturer during production.
- **48-Bit Address**: Typically represented as a **12-digit hexadecimal number** (e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`).
- **Permanent (Mostly)**: MAC addresses are usually **burned into the hardware** but can sometimes be **spoofed** or changed via software.

---

## **2. MAC Address Format**

### **A. Structure**
- A MAC address is **48 bits** long.
- It is divided into **6 groups of 2 hexadecimal digits**, separated by colons (`:`), hyphens (`-`), or no separator.
  - Example: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`
  - Example: `00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E`
  - Example: `001A.2B3C.4D5E` (Cisco format)

### **B. Components**
1. **OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier)**:
   - The **first 24 bits (3 bytes)** of the MAC address.
   - Assigned by the **IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)** to manufacturers.
   - Example: `00:1A:2B` (OUI for a specific manufacturer).

2. **NIC-Specific Identifier**:
   - The **last 24 bits (3 bytes)** of the MAC address.
   - Assigned by the manufacturer to uniquely identify each NIC.
   - Example: `3C:4D:5E`.

---

## **3. How MAC Addresses Are Assigned**

### **A. Manufacturer Assignment**
- The **IEEE** assigns **OUIs** to manufacturers.
- Manufacturers assign the **remaining 24 bits** to each NIC they produce.
- Example: A NIC from **Intel** might have a MAC address starting with `00:1A:2B`, where `00:1A:2B` is Intel’s OUI.

### **B. Static vs. Dynamic MAC Addresses**
- **Static MAC Addresses**: Permanently assigned by the manufacturer.
- **Dynamic MAC Addresses**: Some devices allow **MAC address spoofing** or **randomization** (e.g., for privacy).

---

## **4. What Are MAC Addresses Used For?**

### **A. Device Identification on Local Networks**
- MAC addresses **uniquely identify devices** on a **local network** (e.g., Ethernet or Wi-Fi).
- Used by **switches and routers** to forward data to the correct device.

### **B. Ethernet and Wi-Fi Communication**
- **Ethernet Frames**: MAC addresses are used in the **source** and **destination** fields of Ethernet frames.
- **Wi-Fi Frames**: MAC addresses identify devices in **802.11 (Wi-Fi) frames**.

### **C. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**
- **ARP** maps **IP addresses** to **MAC addresses** on a local network.
  - Example: When Device A wants to send data to Device B, it uses ARP to find Device B’s MAC address.

### **D. Network Security**
- **MAC Filtering**: Routers and access points can **allow or block** devices based on their MAC addresses.
- **Authentication**: Some networks use MAC addresses for **device authentication**.

### **E. Network Troubleshooting**
- **Identifying Devices**: MAC addresses help network administrators **identify and troubleshoot** devices.
- **Tracking Devices**: Used in **network logs** to track device activity.

## **6. How MAC Addresses Work in Network Communication**

### **A. Ethernet Communication**
1. **Device A** wants to send data to **Device B** on the same local network.
2. **Device A** knows **Device B’s IP address** but not its MAC address.
3. **Device A** sends an **ARP request** to the network:
   ```
   ARP Request: "Who has IP 192.168.1.100? Tell 192.168.1.101."
   ```
4. **Device B** responds with its MAC address:
   ```
   ARP Reply: "192.168.1.100 is at MAC 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E."
   ```
5. **Device A** now knows **Device B’s MAC address** and can send the Ethernet frame.

### **B. Wi-Fi Communication**
- In **Wi-Fi networks**, MAC addresses identify devices in **802.11 frames**.
- Access points use MAC addresses to **manage connections** and **filter devices**.

## **7. MAC Address Spoofing**

### **A. What Is MAC Spoofing?**
- **MAC spoofing** is the practice of **changing a device’s MAC address** to impersonate another device or bypass security measures.

### **B. Why Spoof a MAC Address?**
- **Bypass MAC Filtering**: Some networks only allow devices with specific MAC addresses.
- **Privacy**: Randomizing MAC addresses can prevent tracking.
- **Testing**: Network administrators may spoof MAC addresses for testing.

### **C. How to Spoof a MAC Address**
- **Windows**:
  ```powershell
  # Disable the network interface
  netsh interface set interface "Ethernet" admin=disable

  # Set a new MAC address
  netsh interface set interface "Ethernet" newmac=00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E

  # Re-enable the interface
  netsh interface set interface "Ethernet" admin=enable
  ```

- **Linux**:
  ```bash
  # Disable the network interface
  sudo ifconfig eth0 down

  # Set a new MAC address
  sudo ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E

  # Re-enable the interface
  sudo ifconfig eth0 up
  ```

- **macOS**:
  ```bash
  # Disable the network interface
  sudo ifconfig en0 ether 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E

  # Re-enable the interface
  sudo ifconfig en0 up
  ```
