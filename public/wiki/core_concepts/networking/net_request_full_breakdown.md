## **1. User Initiates a Request**
- **Example**: You type `https://www.example.com` into your browser and press **Enter**.
- **Browser Role**: The browser checks its **cache** for a valid IP address for `www.example.com`. If not found, it initiates a **DNS lookup**.

---

## **2. DNS Lookup Process**

### **2.1. Local DNS Cache Check**
- **Browser Cache**: The browser checks its internal DNS cache.
- **OS Cache**: If not found, the OS (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux) checks its DNS cache.
- **Router Cache**: If still not found, the request is sent to the **local router** (default gateway), which may also cache DNS records.

### **2.2. Recursive DNS Query**
- **Local DNS Resolver**: If the IP isn’t cached, your device sends a **recursive DNS query** to your **configured DNS resolver** (e.g., your ISP’s DNS server or a public DNS like Google’s `8.8.8.8`).
- **Resolver’s Role**: The resolver checks its cache. If the IP isn’t cached, it initiates an **iterative DNS query**.

### **2.3. Iterative DNS Query**
1. **Root DNS Servers**:
   - The resolver queries a **root DNS server** (e.g., `a.root-servers.net`).
   - The root server responds with the **TLD (Top-Level Domain) DNS server** for `.com` (e.g., `a.gtld-servers.net`).

2. **TLD DNS Servers**:
   - The resolver queries the `.com` TLD server.
   - The TLD server responds with the **authoritative DNS server** for `example.com` (e.g., `ns1.example-dns.com`).

3. **Authoritative DNS Servers**:
   - The resolver queries the authoritative server for `example.com`.
   - The authoritative server responds with the **IP address** for `www.example.com` (e.g., `93.184.216.34`).

### **2.4. Caching the Result**
- The resolver caches the IP address and returns it to your device.
- Your device caches the IP address for future use.

---

## **3. Establishing a Connection**

### **3.1. TCP/IP Handshake (TCP)**
- Your device initiates a **TCP connection** to the IP address (`93.184.216.34`) on port `443` (HTTPS).
- **Three-Way Handshake**:
  1. **SYN**: Your device sends a **SYN (synchronize)** packet to the server.
  2. **SYN-ACK**: The server responds with a **SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge)** packet.
  3. **ACK**: Your device sends an **ACK (acknowledge)** packet, and the connection is established.

### **3.2. TLS Handshake (HTTPS)**
- If the URL uses `https://`, a **TLS handshake** occurs to establish a secure, encrypted connection:
  1. **Client Hello**: Your device sends supported TLS versions and cipher suites.
  2. **Server Hello**: The server selects a TLS version and cipher suite and sends its **SSL certificate**.
  3. **Certificate Verification**: Your device verifies the certificate with a **Certificate Authority (CA)**.
  4. **Key Exchange**: Your device and the server generate a **shared secret key** for encryption.
  5. **Encrypted Communication**: All further communication is encrypted using the shared key.

---

## **4. Routing the Request**

### **4.1. Local Network Routing**
- **Your Device**: Uses its **routing table** to determine the next hop for the packet. For most home networks, the next hop is the **default gateway** (your router).
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**:
  - Your device checks its **ARP cache** for the MAC address of the default gateway.
  - If not found, it sends an **ARP request** (broadcast) to discover the MAC address of the router.
  - The router responds with its MAC address, and your device updates its ARP cache.

- **Packet Forwarding**:
  - Your device encapsulates the packet with:
    - **Source MAC**: Your device’s MAC address.
    - **Destination MAC**: Router’s MAC address.
    - **Source IP**: Your device’s private IP (e.g., `192.168.1.10`).
    - **Destination IP**: `93.184.216.34` (example.com’s IP).
  - The packet is sent to the router.

---

### **4.2. Router’s Role**
- **NAT (Network Address Translation)**:
  - The router replaces the **source IP** in the packet header with its **public IP** (e.g., `203.0.113.5`).
  - It assigns a **source port** (e.g., `54321`) to track the connection and adds an entry to its **NAT table**.
  - The packet now has:
    - **Source IP**: `203.0.113.5` (router’s public IP).
    - **Source Port**: `54321`.
    - **Destination IP**: `93.184.216.34`.
    - **Destination Port**: `443`.

- **Routing Decision**:
  - The router checks its **routing table** to determine the next hop for `93.184.216.34`.
  - If the destination is on the internet, the router forwards the packet to your **ISP’s gateway**.

---

### **4.3. ISP and Internet Routing**
- **ISP’s Gateway**:
  - Your ISP’s router receives the packet and checks its routing table.
  - It forwards the packet to the next hop in the **internet backbone**, based on **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** routes.

- **Internet Backbone**:
  - The packet traverses multiple **autonomous systems (AS)** and **routers** along the path to `93.184.216.34`.
  - Each router along the path:
    1. Receives the packet.
    2. Checks its **routing table** (populated by BGP, OSPF, or other routing protocols).
    3. Decrements the **TTL (Time To Live)** field in the IP header.
    4. Forwards the packet to the next hop.

---

### **4.4. Destination Network**
- **Edge Router**:
  - The packet arrives at the edge router of `example.com`’s network.
  - The router checks its routing table and forwards the packet to the **internal router** or **load balancer** handling `93.184.216.34`.

- **Firewall/Load Balancer**:
  - The packet passes through a **firewall**, which checks for security rules (e.g., allowed ports, DDoS protection).
  - If `example.com` uses a load balancer, the packet is forwarded to an available **web server**.

---

## **5. Server Processing the Request**

### **5.1. Web Server**
- The web server receives the packet on port `443`.
- The server:
  1. **Decrypts** the TLS-encrypted data.
  2. **Processes** the HTTP request (e.g., `GET /`).
  3. **Generates** an HTTP response (e.g., the HTML for the homepage).

### **5.2. Sending the Response**
- The server sends the response back to your device:
  - **Source IP**: `93.184.216.34`.
  - **Destination IP**: `203.0.113.5` (your router’s public IP).
  - **Source Port**: `443`.
  - **Destination Port**: `54321`.

---

## **6. Return Trip: Response to Your Device**

### **6.1. Internet Routing (Reverse Path)**
- The response packet traverses the internet back to your ISP, following the **reverse path** of the original request.
- Routers along the path use their routing tables to forward the packet toward `203.0.113.5`.

### **6.2. Your ISP’s Gateway**
- Your ISP’s router forwards the packet to your **home router**.

### **6.3. Your Router**
- **NAT Translation**:
  - The router checks its **NAT table** and finds the entry for `203.0.113.5:54321`.
  - It replaces the **destination IP and port** with your device’s private IP and original port (e.g., `192.168.1.10:12345`).
- **ARP Check**:
  - The router checks its ARP cache for your device’s MAC address.
  - If not found, it sends an **ARP request** to discover your device’s MAC address.
- **Packet Forwarding**:
  - The router encapsulates the packet with:
    - **Source MAC**: Router’s MAC address.
    - **Destination MAC**: Your device’s MAC address.
  - The packet is sent to your device.

---

### **6.4. Your Device**
- Your device receives the packet and:
  1. **Decrypts** the TLS data (if HTTPS).
  2. **Processes** the HTTP response (e.g., renders the webpage).
  3. **Displays** the webpage in your browser.

---

## **7. Connection Termination**
- After the response is received, the **TCP connection** is terminated using a **four-way handshake**:
  1. **FIN**: Your device sends a **FIN (finish)** packet.
  2. **ACK**: The server acknowledges the FIN.
  3. **FIN**: The server sends its own FIN packet.
  4. **ACK**: Your device acknowledges the server’s FIN, and the connection is closed.
