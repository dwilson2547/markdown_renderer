#### **1. What is DHCP?**
- **DHCP** is a network protocol used to **automatically assign IP addresses** and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network.
- It eliminates the need for manual IP configuration, reducing errors and administrative overhead.
- DHCP operates at the **Application Layer (Layer 7)** of the OSI model and uses **UDP ports 67 (server) and 68 (client)**.

---

#### **2. Key Components**
- **DHCP Server**: A device (e.g., router, server) that manages and assigns IP addresses.
- **DHCP Client**: Any device (e.g., laptop, phone) requesting an IP address.
- **DHCP Pool**: A range of IP addresses available for assignment (e.g., `192.168.1.100` to `192.168.1.200`).
- **Lease Time**: The duration for which an IP address is assigned to a client.

#### **3. The DHCP Process (DORA)**
The DHCP process involves **four steps**, often referred to as **DORA**:

1. **Discover**
2. **Offer**
3. **Request**
4. **Acknowledge**

---

#### **4. Detailed Step-by-Step Process**

##### **Step 1: DHCP Discover**
- **Client Action**: When a device connects to a network, it sends a **DHCP Discover** message as a **broadcast** (destination MAC: `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`).
- **Purpose**: The client is asking, "Are there any DHCP servers out there?"
- **Message Contents**:
  - Source MAC: Client’s MAC address.
  - Destination MAC: Broadcast (`FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`).
  - Source IP: `0.0.0.0` (client has no IP yet).
  - Destination IP: `255.255.255.255` (broadcast).
  - DHCP Options: Includes the **DHCP Discover** flag.

---

##### **Step 2: DHCP Offer**
- **Server Action**: Any DHCP server on the network receives the broadcast and responds with a **DHCP Offer** message, also as a **broadcast**.
- **Purpose**: The server offers an available IP address and other configuration parameters.
- **Message Contents**:
  - **Your Client IP Address**: Proposed IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).
  - **Subnet Mask**: (e.g., `255.255.255.0`).
  - **Lease Time**: (e.g., 24 hours).
  - **Default Gateway**: (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
  - **DNS Servers**: (e.g., `8.8.8.8`).
  - **DHCP Server IP**: The server’s IP address.

---

##### **Step 3: DHCP Request**
- **Client Action**: The client selects one of the offers (if multiple servers respond) and sends a **DHCP Request** broadcast.
- **Purpose**: The client confirms which server’s offer it is accepting.
- **Message Contents**:
  - **Requested IP Address**: The IP offered by the selected server.
  - **DHCP Server IP**: The IP of the server whose offer is accepted.

---

##### **Step 4: DHCP Acknowledge (ACK)**
- **Server Action**: The selected DHCP server sends a **DHCP ACK** message to the client, confirming the assignment.
- **Purpose**: The server finalizes the IP address assignment and provides all configuration details.
- **Message Contents**:
  - **IP Address**: Confirmed IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).
  - **Subnet Mask**: (e.g., `255.255.255.0`).
  - **Lease Time**: (e.g., 24 hours).
  - **Default Gateway**: (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
  - **DNS Servers**: (e.g., `8.8.8.8`).

#### **5. DHCP Lease Renewal**
- **T1 (Renewal Time)**: At **50% of the lease time**, the client attempts to renew its lease with the original server.
- **T2 (Rebinding Time)**: At **87.5% of the lease time**, the client broadcasts a renewal request to any DHCP server if the original server is unavailable.
- **Lease Expiry**: If the lease is not renewed, the client stops using the IP address and must restart the DORA process.

#### **6. DHCP Message Format**
All DHCP messages use the same format, based on the **BOOTP** protocol:



| Field               | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Opcode**          | `1` for request, `2` for reply.                                             |
| **Hardware Type**   | Typically `1` for Ethernet.                                                 |
| **Hardware Address Length** | `6` for Ethernet MAC addresses.                                      |
| **Hops**            | Used by relay agents (usually `0`).                                         |
| **Transaction ID**  | Random number to match requests and replies.                                |
| **Seconds**         | Time elapsed since the client started the DHCP process.                    |
| **Flags**           | Indicates broadcast (e.g., `0x8000` for broadcast).                         |
| **Client IP**       | Filled in by the client if renewing; otherwise `0.0.0.0`.                   |
| **Your Client IP**  | IP address offered by the server.                                           |
| **Server IP**       | IP address of the DHCP server.                                              |
| **Gateway IP**      | IP address of the relay agent (if used).                                    |
| **Client MAC**      | Client’s hardware address.                                                 |
| **Options**         | Additional configuration (e.g., subnet mask, lease time, DNS servers).      |

#### **7. DHCP Relay Agents**
- **Purpose**: In large networks, a **DHCP relay agent** forwards DHCP messages between clients and servers on different subnets.
- **How It Works**:
  - The relay agent receives the **DHCP Discover** broadcast.
  - It converts the broadcast into a **unicast** message and forwards it to the DHCP server.
  - The server sends the reply back to the relay agent, which then broadcasts it to the client.

---

#### **8. Example DHCP Process**
1. **Client (Laptop)** connects to the network and broadcasts a **DHCP Discover** message.
2. **DHCP Server (Router)** receives the message and responds with a **DHCP Offer** (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).
3. **Client** accepts the offer and broadcasts a **DHCP Request** for `192.168.1.100`.
4. **Server** confirms with a **DHCP ACK**, and the client configures its network interface with the provided IP and settings.

---

#### **9. Common DHCP Issues**
- **No IP Address**: If the client fails to receive a DHCP offer, it may use a **link-local address** (e.g., `169.254.x.x`).
- **IP Conflicts**: Rare in DHCP but can occur if a static IP is assigned within the DHCP range.
- **Slow Response**: High network latency or misconfigured relay agents can delay the process.

#### **10. Why DHCP is Essential**
- **Automation**: Eliminates manual IP configuration.
- **Flexibility**: Supports dynamic networks (e.g., Wi-Fi hotspots).
- **Scalability**: Easily manages large networks with thousands of devices.
