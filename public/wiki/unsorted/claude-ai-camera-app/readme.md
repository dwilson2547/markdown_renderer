I'll create a comprehensive camera application for your Raspberry Pi 4 setup. This will be a full-featured camera app with manual controls, GPS integration, and power management.I've created a comprehensive camera application for your Raspberry Pi 4 setup. Here are the key features:

## Main Features

**Camera Controls:**
- Auto and manual modes with full control over shutter speed, ISO, brightness, contrast, etc.
- High-resolution photo capture (4056x3040) and HD video recording (1920x1080)
- Real-time preview on your ST7796U display (320x480)

**GPS Integration:**
- Automatically embeds GPS coordinates into photo EXIF data
- Shows GPS status in the UI
- Works with USB GPS modules via gpsd

**Power Management:**
- Low power mode that disables preview and reduces frame rate
- Normal mode for full functionality
- Toggle between modes with 'P' key

**User Interface:**
- Touch-friendly menu system (navigate with arrow keys)
- Status bar showing current mode, recording status, GPS fix
- On-screen help for controls

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install picamera2 pygame gpsd-py3 pillow piexif
```

2. **Enable Hardware:**
```bash
sudo raspi-config
# Enable Camera and SPI interfaces
```

3. **Setup GPS:**
```bash
sudo apt install gpsd gpsd-clients
sudo systemctl enable gpsd
sudo systemctl start gpsd
```

4. **Configure GPS (edit /etc/default/gpsd):**
```
DEVICES="/dev/ttyUSB0"  # or your GPS device
GPSD_OPTIONS="-n"
```

## Controls

- **SPACE**: Open/close menu
- **ENTER**: Take photo (when menu closed)
- **R**: Start/stop video recording
- **P**: Toggle power mode
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate menu
- **ESC**: Exit application

## File Organization

The app creates:
- `photos/` directory for captured images
- `videos/` directory for recorded videos
- Photos are named with timestamps: `photo_20241202_143022.jpg`

## Advanced Features

- **Manual Camera Control**: Adjust shutter speed (100Î¼s to 50ms), ISO (100-1600), and other parameters
- **EXIF GPS Data**: Latitude, longitude, altitude, and timestamp embedded in photos
- **Power Optimization**: Configurable frame rates and preview disable for battery conservation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for GPS and camera issues

The application is designed to work reliably with your specific hardware combination and provides both automatic operation for casual use and full manual control for photography enthusiasts.
