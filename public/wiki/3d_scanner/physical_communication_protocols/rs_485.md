# RS-485 Communications: A Technical Overview

---

## Introduction
**RS-485** is a standard for serial communication that supports **multi-point, long-distance, and noise-resistant** data transmission. It is widely used in industrial environments for connecting multiple devices over a single pair of wires.

---

## Key Features
- **Differential Signaling**: Uses two wires (A and B) to transmit data, improving noise immunity.
- **Multi-Drop Network**: Supports up to **32 or 256 devices** (depending on driver strength) on a single bus.
- **Long Distance**: Up to **1200 meters (4000 feet)** at lower speeds.
- **Half-Duplex or Full-Duplex**:
  - **Half-Duplex**: Uses 2 wires for bidirectional communication (one direction at a time).
  - **Full-Duplex**: Uses 4 wires for simultaneous bidirectional communication.
- **High Noise Immunity**: Ideal for industrial environments.
- **Baud Rate**: Supports speeds up to **10 Mbps** (distance-dependent).

## Physical Interface
### Wiring
- **2-Wire (Half-Duplex)**: Uses **A** and **B** for data transmission.
- **4-Wire (Full-Duplex)**: Uses **A+, B+** for TX and **A-, B-** for RX.

| Wire | Description                     |
|------|---------------------------------|
| A    | Non-inverting (positive) signal |
| B    | Inverting (negative) signal     |
| GND  | Optional ground reference       |

### Connectors
- Commonly uses **screw terminals** or **DB-9 connectors**.

## Electrical Characteristics
- **Voltage Levels**:
  - **Logic 1 (Mark)**: A is negative with respect to B (-1.5V to -5V).
  - **Logic 0 (Space)**: A is positive with respect to B (+1.5V to +5V).
- **Common Mode Voltage Range**: -7V to +12V.
- **Termination**: Requires **120Ω resistors** at both ends of the bus to prevent signal reflections.

---

## Protocol Basics
- **Asynchronous or Synchronous**: Typically uses **UART** for asynchronous communication.
- **Data Format**: Similar to RS-232 (start bit, data bits, parity, stop bit).
- **Baud Rate**: Configurable (e.g., 9600, 19200, 115200 bps).

---

## Network Topology
- **Bus Topology**: All devices share the same A and B lines.
- **Termination**: Required at both ends of the bus to prevent signal reflections.
- **Biasing**: Optional pull-up/pull-down resistors to ensure idle bus state.

---

## Advantages
- **Long Distance**: Up to 1200 meters.
- **Multi-Drop**: Supports multiple devices on a single bus.
- **Noise Immunity**: Differential signaling rejects common-mode noise.
- **High Speed**: Faster than RS-232 for long-distance communication.

---

## Limitations
- **Complexity**: Requires proper termination and biasing.
- **Collision Risk**: Half-duplex mode requires careful timing to avoid data collisions.
- **No Built-in Error Correction**: Relies on higher-layer protocols.

---

## Common Applications
- **Industrial Automation**: PLCs, sensors, and actuators.
- **Building Automation**: HVAC, lighting control.
- **Telecommunications**: Base stations, remote terminals.

## Troubleshooting Tips
1. **Check Termination**: Ensure 120Ω resistors are present at both ends.
2. **Verify Wiring**: Confirm A and B are correctly connected (not reversed).
3. **Grounding**: Avoid ground loops; use a single ground reference if possible.
4. **Signal Quality**: Use an oscilloscope to check for noise or reflections.
5. **Baud Rate**: Ensure all devices use the same baud rate.

## Example: Wiring a 2-Wire RS-485 Bus
Device 1 ----A----[Twisted Pair]----A---- Device 2
----B----------------B----/
- Add **120Ω termination resistors** between A and B at both ends.
