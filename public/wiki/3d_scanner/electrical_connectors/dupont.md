# DuPont Connectors

DuPont connectors are a family of low-cost, versatile electrical connectors commonly used in electronics prototyping, hobbyist projects, and low-current applications. Originally developed by DuPont (now part of TE Connectivity), these connectors are characterized by their 0.1" (2.54mm) pitch spacing and simple friction-fit connection mechanism.

## Overview

DuPont connectors feature:
- 2.54mm (0.1") pitch spacing (compatible with standard breadboards)
- Simple friction-fit mating mechanism
- No locking mechanism (relies on friction)
- Low-cost construction
- Easy field assembly
- Wide variety of housing configurations
- Operating temperature: -55°C to +105°C
- Voltage rating: Up to 250V AC/DC
- Current rating: 3A per contact (depending on wire gauge)

## Connector Types

### Standard DuPont Series
The most common type, featuring plastic housings with friction-fit contacts.

### Jumper Wires
Pre-assembled wire-to-wire connections with DuPont terminals.

### Pin Headers
Male pin strips designed to mate with DuPont housings.

### Socket Headers
Female socket strips, often used on PCBs.

- **High resistance**: Clean contacts with isopropyl alcohol

### Testing
- Use multimeter for continuity testing
- Check voltage drops across connections
- Verify proper crimping with gentle pull test
- Inspect for bent or damaged pins

## Storage and Handling

### Best Practices
- Store in anti-static bags when possible
- Keep housings and terminals separated until use
- Avoid bending pins excessively
- Protect contacts from contamination
- Use proper orientation when mating/unmating

### Inventory Management
- Color-code wire sets for easy identification
- Keep common sizes (2, 3, 4, 5-pin) readily available
- Maintain stock of both male and female jumper wires
- Store in organized compartmented boxes
